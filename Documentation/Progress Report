Basic Concept of App: The game will consist of a NxM (depending what looks best on screen) grid space that contains 12, 24, or 36 tiles depending on user choice. Score will be tracked by gaining a point for getting a pair correct and losing a point for an incorrect pair. Where the user's best and average score is tracked for the day and can be compared to the day prior average.

Solution App will Provide: By tracking the computer generated results of the userâ€™s response, the user can make an assessment as to how they are progressing.
